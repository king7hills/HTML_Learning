        <!-- <a> is the anchor tag. Acts as a link. -->

        <!-- href directs the link
             target allows for link in new tab or window
             rel is a security measure - noopener prevents linked site from accessing webpage that opened it
             noreferrer prevents opened link from knowing which webpage or resource has a link to it (reference) -->
